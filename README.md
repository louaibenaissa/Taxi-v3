# Reinforcement Learning for Taxi-v3 Simulation

**Author : Louai Abdallah BENAISSA**

## Overview
This repository is a personal project aimed at applying **model-free Q-Learning**, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique, to the `Taxi-v3` environment from OpenAI's Gym. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by implementing and experimenting with Q-Learning to solve the Taxi-v3 game.

The `Taxi-v3` environment is a classic grid-world problem where an agent (a taxi) must navigate a grid to pick up and drop off passengers at specific locations. The challenge lies in learning the optimal policy to maximize rewards while avoiding penalties.
