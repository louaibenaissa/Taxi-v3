# Reinforcement Learning for Taxi-v3 Simulation

**Author : Louai Abdallah BENAISSA**

## Overview
This repository is a personal project aimed at applying **model-free Q-Learning**, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique, to the `Taxi-v3` environment from OpenAI's Gym. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by implementing and experimenting with Q-Learning to solve the Taxi-v3 game.

The `Taxi-v3` environment is a classic grid-world problem where an agent (a taxi) must navigate a grid to pick up and drop off passengers at specific locations. The challenge lies in learning the optimal policy to maximize rewards while avoiding penalties.

## Objectives
- Implement **Q-Learning**, a model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithm, to solve the Taxi-v3 environment.
- Understand the nuances of Q-Learning by tuning hyperparameters, observing convergence, and analyzing the agent's performance.
- Document the learning process, challenges faced, and insights gained to reinforce understanding.

## Why Q-Learning?
Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy by iteratively updating the Q-values of state-action pairs. It is a foundational RL algorithm and serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning. This project focuses solely on Q-Learning to ensure a deep and practical understanding of its mechanics.
